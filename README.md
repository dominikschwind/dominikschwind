# Hi there 👋

This is the account I use for _work-related_ stuff while [@lostfocus](https://github.com/lostfocus) is for private 
and OpenSource things.  
(Even though *sometimes* these things might get mixed up in commits. My `.gitconfig` magic is a bit wonky.)

And yet, here is what I have done on my blog, my linkblog and my photoblog:
